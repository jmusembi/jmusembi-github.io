	<h2>Other Advanced Routing Topics</h2>
	Page Reloading
	The $location service does not reload the entire page; it simply changes the URL. If we need to
	cause a full page reload, we have to set the location using the $window service:
	1
	$window.location.href = "/reload/page";

	<h2>Async Location Changes</h2>
	If we need to use the $location service outside of the scope life cycle, we have to use the $apply
	function to propagate the changes throughout the app. Thatâ€™s because the $location service uses
	the $digest phase as the impetus to start the browser route change, which is how routing events
	work.
