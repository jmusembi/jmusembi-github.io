	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<h2>Multiple Views and Routing</h2>
		In a single-page app, navigating from one page view to another is crucial. When apps grow more
		and more complex, we need a way to manage the screens that a user will see as they navigate
		their way through the app.
		We can already support such management by including template code in line in the main HTML,
		but not only will this in-line code grow large and unmanageable, it will also make it difficult to
		allow other developers to join in development. Additionally, we can’t copy the URL and send it
		to our friends because the state of the application needs to be contained in the URL.
		Rather than including multiple templates in the view (which we could do with the ng-include
		directive), we can break out the view into a layout and template views and only show the view
		we want to show based upon the URL the user is currently accessing.
		We’ll break these partial templates into views to be composed inside of a layout template.
		AngularJS allows us to do that by declaring routes on the $routeProvider , a provider of the
		$route service.
		Using the $routeProvider , we can take advantage of the browser’s history navigation and enable
		users to bookmark and share specific pages, as it uses the current URL location in the browser.
