				<h1>Split column paragraph</h1>
				<p>
					Although desktop and laptop screens have
					gotten wider in recent years, studies still
					show that people have difficulty reading
					long lines of text. (Roughly 65 to 75 charac-
					ters per line is generally considered a comfortable
					length to read.) This convention has led to restricted layouts and websites that don’t take advantage of the opportunities presented by wider screens.24	30
					For years, magazines and newspapers have used multiple columns to
					flow content—addressing both the issue of long text lines and how to pack
					a lot of copy into limited spaces. Now, with the advent of the Multi-column
					Layout Module in CSS3 (http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/), websites can
					take advantage of multiple columns, too.
					The Multi-column Layout Module currently has Candidate Recom­men­
					da­t ion status, meaning the module is considered mostly complete and is
					well implemented in IE10+ and other modern browsers (albeit with some
					minor caveats), so you have plenty of opportunities to experiment with mul-
					tiple columns.Column Layout Methods
					You can divide your content into columns using two methods: either pre-
					scriptively, by setting a specific number of columns, or dynamically, by
					specifying the width of columns and allowing the browser to calculate how
					many columns will fit into the width of the parent element.
					Note that, although Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE10+ all support the
					properties in this chapter at the time of writing, the latter browser is the
					only one to do so without a vendor prefix. The different browsers also have
					a few implementation quirks, which I’ll point out as I go along.
