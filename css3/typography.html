					Text content has been the backbone of the
					Web since its creation, yet for years we’ve
					had to make do with a limited set of tools.
					CSS3 hugely expands its typographic toolset by
					introducing a range of new and updated features in
					the Text Module. 24	30
					Chief among these new features is the ability to add shadows to text.
					Although this addition doesn’t sound particularly revolutionary—print
					typographers have been using shadows for a long time—the new syntax is
					flexible enough to allow for some very nice effects. A similar feature is text-
					outlining (or text-stroking), which, although not widely implemented, does
					increase the variety of options available when creating decorative headlines.
					In addition to these are some less flashy effects but ones that can do won-
					ders for your text’s readability.
					The CSS Text Level 3 Module (http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/) cur-
					rently has Last Call Working Draft status; however, some elements are well
					implemented and ready for you to use straightaway.Before I introduce the first new property in this module, I’ll briefly
					introduce the concepts of coordinates and axes. If you’re already familiar
					with these, feel free to skip this section; otherwise, read on.
