		<h1>Reduce the screensize to see the image disappear</h1>
		This paragraph, unremarkable in most ways, does contain an inline element.
		This inline contains some <strong>strongly emphasized text, which is
		so marked to make an important point</strong>. The rest of the element's
		content is normal anonymous inline content.
