		<span id="first-character">W</span>ith CSS, it is possible to completely change the way elements are presented by a
		user agent. This can be executed at a basic level with the display property, and in a
		different way by associating style sheets with a document. The user will never know
		whether this is done via an external or embedded style sheet, or even with an inline
		style.

		<p class="second-paragraph">
		The real importance of external style sheets is the way in which they allow
		authors to put all of a sites presentation information in one place, and point all of
		the documents to that place. This not only makes site updates and maintenance a
		breeze, but it helps to save bandwidth since all of the presentation is removed from
		documents.
