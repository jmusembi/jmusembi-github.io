			So, now you can place the origin image for the background anywhere in the back-
			ground of an element, and you can control (to a degree) how it tiles. As you may
			already have realized, though, placing an image in the center of the body element may
			mean, given a sufficiently long document, that the background image won’t be ini-
			tially visible to the reader. After all, a browser provides only a window onto the doc-
			ument. If the document is too long to be displayed in the window, then the user can
			scroll back and forth through the document. The center could be two or three
			“screens” below the beginning of the document, or just far enough down to push
			most of the origin image beyond the bottom of the browser window.
			Furthermore, even if you assume that the origin image is initially visible, it always
			scrolls with the document—it’ll vanish every time a user scrolls beyond the image’s
			location. Never fear: there is a way to prevent this scrolling.

			So there you have it: stripes running through the center of the elements. It may look
			wrong, but it isn’t.
			The examples shown in Figure 9-30 are correct because the origin image has been
			placed in the center of the first p element and then tiled along the y-axis in both direc-
			tions—in other words, both up and down. For the second paragraph, the images are
			repeated to the right and left.
			Therefore, setting a large image in the center of the p and then letting it fully repeat
			will cause it to tile in all four directions: up, down, left, and right. The only differ-
			ence background-position makes is in determining where the tiling starts. Figure 9-31
			shows the difference between tiling from the center of an element and from its top-
			left corner.
