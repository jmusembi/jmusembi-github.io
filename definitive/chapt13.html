			<h1>Customization</h1>
		<p>Such customization increases the odds that the user will be able to read the docu-
ment, since he has presumably configured his operating system to be usable. (If not,
he deserves whatever he gets)
There are 28 system color keywords in total, although CSS does not explicitly define
them. Instead, there are some generic (and very short) descriptions of each keywords meaning.
 The following list describes all 28 keywords. In cases where there is
a direct analog with the options in the Appearance tab of the Display control panel
in Windows 2000, it is noted parenthetically after the description.
</p>

<h1>Margins</h1>
<p>
Because CSS2 allows for some odd page-breaking styles, it defines a set of behaviors
regarding allowed page breaks and “best” page breaks. These behaviors guide user
agents in how they should handle page breaking in various circumstances.
There are really only two generic places where page breaks are permitted. The first of
these is between two block-level boxes. If a page break falls between two block
boxes, then the margin-bottom value of the element before the page break is reset to
0 , as is the margin-top of the element following the page break. However, there are
two rules that allow a page break to fall between two element boxes:
• If the value of page-break-after for the first element—or the value of page-break-
before for the second element—is always , left , or right . This is true regardless of
the value for theother element, even if it’s avoid . (This is a forced page break.)
• If the value of the first element’s page-break-after value is auto , and the same is
true for the second element’s page-break-before value, and if they do not share
an ancestor element whose page-break-inside value is not avoid .
</p>

<h1>Paragraph</h1>
<p>
This means that any paragraph can have no fewer than four line boxes appear at the
top of a page. If the layout of the document would lead to fewer line boxes, then the
entire paragraph is placed at the top of the page. Consider the situation shown in
Figure 14-6. Cover up the top part of the figure with your hand, so only the second
page is visible. Notice that there are two line boxes there, from the end of a para-
graph that started on the previous page. Given the default widows value of 2 , this is an
acceptable rendering. However, if the value were 3 or higher, the entire paragraph
would appear at the top of the second page as a single block. This would require that
a page break be inserted before the paragraph in question.
Look again at Figure 14-6, but this time cover up the second page with your hand.
Notice the four line boxes at the bottom of the page, at the beginning of the last
paragraph. This is fine as long as the value of orphans is 4 or less. If it were 5 or
higher, the paragraph would again be prece.
</p>

<h1>Going further</h1>
<p>
Now, suppose further that you have a situation where an h4 is placed between two
images, and its height calculates to half an inch. Each image will have to be printed
on a separate page, but there are only two places the h4 can go: at the bottom of the
page holding the first element, or on the page after it. If it’s placed after the first
image, then it must be followed by a page break, since there’s no room for the sec-
ond image to follow it, as shown in Figure 14-5.
On the other hand, if the h4 is placed on a new page following the first image, there
won’t be room on that same page for the second image. So, again, there will be a
page break after the h4 . And, in either case, at least one image, if not both, will be
preceded by a page break. There’s only so much the user agent can do, given a situa-
tion like this one.
Obviously, situations such as these are rare, but they can happen—for example, in a
case where a document contains nothing but tables preceded by headings. There
may be cases where tables print in such a way that they force a heading element to be.

<h1>System colors</h1>
<p>
Such customization increases the odds that the user will be able to read the docu-
ment, since he has presumably configured his operating system to be usable. (If not,
he deserves whatever he gets)
