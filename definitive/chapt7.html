		<h1>This begins the header</h1>
		<p>The marker attached to a list item element can be either outside the content of the
list item or treated as an inline marker at the beginning of the content, depending on

   	<h3>Run-in Elements</h3>
<p>
Another interesting block/inline hybrid is the value <code>run-in</code>, introduced
in CSS2, which has the ability to take block-level elements and make them an inline
part of a following element. This is useful for certain heading effects that are
quite common in print typography, where a heading will appear as part of a paragraph
of text.
